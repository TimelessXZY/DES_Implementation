# DES_Implementation
This is the project 1 of course Security & Privacy.

# Basic Functionalities
1. No restriction to the length of plain text and keys.
2. Beautiful user interface
3. Encryption & Decryption are two independent components

Hello, professors. In this video, I will briefly show my implementation of DES algorithm and the basic operation guidelines of my project.

First of all, in this file, there are four main parts of DES. 
The first part is operation tables. 
The second part is type conversion, which includes the char-unicode conversion, unicode-bit and byte-bit conversions. 
The third part is DES algorithm which implements in DES_pipeline and generate_keys functions.
The fourth part is user interface which includes classes of windows and components.

Next I will briefly show the guidelines of operation. 
In this encryption component, click the button TO DECRYPTION at the right upper corner will turn to the decryption component 
and click the button TO ENCRYPTION will turn to the encryption component again. 
In encryption component, type plain text and key in the frames
and then click the encipher button will get the encrypted text in the frame below. The decryption processes are similar.

That's much of it. Thanks for watching.
